Yara Usage:

	usage: yara [OPTION]... RULES_FILE FILE | PID!
	options:!
		-t <tag> print rules tagged as <tag> and ignore the rest. !
		-i <identifier> print rules named <identifier> and ignore the rest.!
		-n print only not satisfied rules (negate).!
		-g print tags.!
		-m print metadata.!
		-s print matching strings.!
		-p <number> use the specified <number> of threads to scan a directory.!
		-l <number> abort scanning after matching a number of rules.!
		-a <seconds> abort scanning after a number of seconds has elapsed.!
		-d <identifier>=<value> define external variable.!
		-r recursively search directories.!
		-f fast matching mode.!
		-w disable warnings.!
		-v show version information.!

Example Rule:

	rule Rule_Name : tag1 tag2 // name of the rule followed by : tags
	{

 	meta: // Useful meta information examples to add
 		description = "Description"
      		author = "Tyler Halfpop"

      		date = "2014-07"
      		md5 = "44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f" 
 	
 	strings:
		$text_string = "text here" nocase wide ascii fullword
		/* 
		text string - 
			nocase = case insensitive
			wide 2 bytes per char
			ascii needed only with wide to search ascii as well
			fullword matches only if delimited by non-alphanumeric characters
		*/
		
		$hex_string = { EB FE [2-4] ?? (13 37 | 73 31 }
		/*
		hex string - ? wild card, [2-4] arbitrary bytes, (x | y) = (x or y)
		*/

		$reg_ex = /md5: [0-9a-zA-Z]{32}/
		/*
		string modifiers nocase, wide, ascii, and fullword can be used

		\t Tab (HT, TAB)
		\n New line (LF, NL)
		\r Return (CR)
